This actually led to the creation of my ScammingBank, where I spent about 3 months trying to build it. Due to lack of time, I didn’t implement all the features I wanted to. We all know that the most trustworthy app is supposed to be the bank, so I was planning to include services like Uber, Uber Eats, Just Eat, Amazon, eBay and much more – where people could order taxis, food, or items without using their details across multiple apps. That’s one small key to prevent data theft.

Even after today, my ScammingBank will not be left like this or forgotten like the rest of my assessments. I will keep building it with more functionality, and I will make it my key to open jobs in the IT industry.
